     * Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
     * Output: 6
     * Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

     * If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

     * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

     * If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
     *
     * Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]

     *              Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
